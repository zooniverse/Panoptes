A User is representation of the identity and contributions of a volunteer.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | Integer |
created_at | string |
updated_at | string |
credited_name | string | Publicly available name with which a volunteer will be credited on papers, posters, etc
login | string |
display_name | string |
email | string | The email of the user
zooniverse_id | string
classifications_count | integer | Number of classifications this user has made site-wide
languages | Array(String) | Array of language identifier string, in order from most to least preferred. Used to determine which language to show translated projects in.

`id`, `zooniverse_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `classification_count`
 are created and updated by the Panoptes API.

 `credited_name` is the publicly available name with which a volunteer will be
 credited on papers, posters, etc. When serialized, if an `@` character is
 found, the user's login will be returned instead for privacy reasons.

The `email` attribute is only available if the requesting user is an
administrator or the user resource being requested is that of the requesting
user.
